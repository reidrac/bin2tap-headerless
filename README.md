bin2tap with header-less blocks
===============================

This is based on version 1.3 from: http://zeroteam.sk/bin2tap.html

The development seems to have moved to:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/zxspectrumutils/

The new package is under the GPL, but the version 1.3 I modified doesn't have a
licence, so I'm going to leave like it is and just release the code with my
changes in case this is useful to anybody else.

This isn't maintained, use it at your own risk.

Motivation
----------

If you want to make your own loader using ROM functions and want to speed up
things a little, you can use header-less blocks in the tap.

That's why I added a `-headerless` option to bin2tap. Other than that, it works
just like version 1.3.
